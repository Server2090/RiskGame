# RISK Game
## _Created by Mintas Ivaska_

The RISK Game is my own personal representation of the Nintendo Switch Risk Game. All of the code was hand coded and the graphics were handmade as well. 

## Installation

- Download the entire directory containing all of the files
- Download Python 3.0 or later from the Microsoft Store or other installation method
- Double click or run the .py file

### Warning
Due to the technical difficulties with uploading the sound files since they are so large, there may be some minor technical difficulties of file not found errors due to the sound files not existing. They can be resolved by commenting out all code that relate to the sound files.

## Directions for Playing
Follow all onscreen prompts
